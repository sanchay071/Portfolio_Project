1,Conceptual Model of Instructional Design,"In this project, my teammate and I investigated the factors driving grading systems in middle and high schools across the US and the need for a taxonomy to interpret state education guidelines. The findings of the study can be applied to both standards-based education and competency-based education. For this project, we focused on data collection in Kansas, where my teammate works as a middle school educator.",imgs/1_cover.jpg,"As I started my graduate studies in the spring of 2024, I collaborated with an educator from Kansas to develop a research topic for a 600-level course project. The course was <strong>""Advanced Learning Environments Design</strong>,""  focused on <strong>Instructional Design</strong> and modes of curriculum delivery. It was a two-member group project. Our project focused on standardizing curriculum definitions and grading systems for K-12 education across the United States. Schools in the U.S. follow varying curriculum structures and grading mechanisms dictated by education boards, which depend primarily on the state and school district. Interpretations of academic standards and assessment rubrics vary significantly. We identified terminologies and concepts that are loosely interconnected both in real time and within digital systems.<p>We initially bounced ideas, as shown in the image below. My teammate <strong>lamented, from her own experience,</strong> how challenging it can be to interpret state standards into measurable outcomes. We initially started detailing higher-level concepts such as <strong>standards-based education, competency-based education,</strong> and the use of technology in instructional design. In Iowa, most schools implement standards-based education, although some also provide competency-based education. We aimed to begin with my teammate's school system as our focal point. Our foundational questions were:</p> 

<ul>
<li>How can the grading system be standardized for my teammate's school?</li>
<li>How to ensure equitable learning outcomes for all students?</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these questions, we set out to identify real-world objects, their definitions, and how they are interconnected.</p>","We utilized the <strong>Design Thinking for Educators Toolkit</strong> by IDEO as a tool to ideate and reflect throughout the project life-cycle. The initial phase involved specifying the problem. My teammate, who is an educator, contributed to developing the problem statement. We aimed to understand the <strong>current state of her school curriculum</strong>, especially in middle and high schools, as well as the methods and metrics that teachers use to assess students. Additionally, most schools employ Canvas LMS for curriculum management and assessment. We identified noticeable design problems and noted down vague wishes, and complaints. This <strong>thought experiment</strong> led to the formulation of <strong>How might we?</strong> questions. ","The goal of this project is to establish a <strong>taxonomy</strong> for implementing curriculum standards as defined by different states in the U.S. Competencies can be defined based on this taxonomy. By defining a taxonomy, we can provide a template for educators to develop their curriculum and translate those standards into Canvas's Learning Management System (LMS). Curriculum design varies greatly among curriculum designers, and the absence of a standard yet flexible interpretation has become a central problem. Additionally, mapping assessments such as quizzes, assignments, and discussions to course criteria in the Canvas LMS must align with the course outcomes established by the state's educational guidelines. The project was <strong>exploratory and qualitative</strong>. For this project, we focused specifically on Iowa state standards.","Before the elicitation process, we gathered a list of terms and descriptions that exist in the real world and within the system. In Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), an outcome refers to a measurable statement that defines what students should know or be able to do at the end of a learning experience. Outcomes are used to assess student learning and performance, aligning with specific educational standards or learning goals.<p>The real-world objects were vastly different from the objects contained within the system. When the nomenclature is different across spaces, the object map and its relationships become disconnected. That's the problem we set out to solve.</p><p>Refer to the list of definitions provided by Education Department of Iowa - <a href=""https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://educate.iowa.gov/media/4803/download?inline%3D"" target=""_blank"">Iowa State Guidelines</a></p>","Given the project's duration, the research was qualitative and exploratory in nature. We identified educators and subject matter experts for user interviews. One of my teammates focused on discovering insights from her discussions with educators at her school. I conducted unstructured conversations with an industry expert who specializes in Human Factors and is also an experienced educator. We used IDEO's research preparation template as a starting point. The selection of the interview location was crucial, as human subjects tend to feel more comfortable in their natural environment.","We set forth by asking fundamental questions. 
<ul>
<li>What metrics are used to evaluate student competencies?</li>
            <li>Who is responsible for curriculum definition, and where do educators fit in this process?</li>
            <li>To what degree is the curriculum design process in your school automated?</li>
            <li>How are the outcomes defined in state education guidelines translated into the LMS?</li>
            </ul>
        
The educators echoed the following themes in our discussions.
<ul>
            <li>Curriculum outcomes are manually aligned with rubrics in the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS)</li>
            <li>There is no standardized definition of outcomes in Canvas LMS across various educational institutions</li>
            <li>Lack of transferability between rubrics and different items necessitates creative workarounds by teachers, which makes the module flow challenging for students</li>
            <li> Rubrics are added manually to assignments (assignments, quizzes, discussions)</li>
            </ul>","We identified a recurring theme from the conversations. <ul>
            <li>Instructors would prefer to spend less time on curriculum creation, defining course outcomes, and developing rubrics </li>
            <li>Only a small number of educators create their rubrics</li>
            <li>Educators often wish for someone else to define the course outcomes</li>
            <li>Outcomes can exist independently and are not necessarily a part of the Courses module in the LMS</li>
            <li>There is less alignment between the mapping course assignments and course criteria in the LMS.</li>
            </ul>
            Before developing <strong>user story maps and prototypes</strong>, I identified a potential taxonomic workflow for translating broad education standards into actionable outcomes. The example in the image depicts <strong>Number Systems</strong> for eighth-grade mathematics. Real-world objects are categorized into discrete units before being interpreted into the system. Iowa Core Standards were used as the reference for defining the workflow. Goals are learning outcomes a student is expected to acquire by the end of a course or concept. The learning goals presented are defined by Iowa's education department for eighth-grade mathematics. The <strong>Platform</strong> quadrant illustrates the system's objects, decomposition, and relationships. Each learning outcome can be evaluated through one or more criteria. Evaluation is conducted through various course activities, delivered through assignments and assessments in Canvas. From the themes discussed with participants, we identified insights and perspectives that facilitated interpretation and meaning-making.","After decomposing tasks, I developed <strong>user roles, user activities, and user stories</strong> for identified tasks. My teammate, as an educator, validated the decomposition. We also sought to verify the requirements with a curriculum coordinator in my teammate's institution. Their comments can be seen as green stickies in the image below. High-level activities were identified for each user role and were decomposed into tasks and user stories. User stories are written from the perspective of the user and describe the end result that the user envisions in their mind. 

<p>To find a potential solution, it was essential to build a foundational taxonomy that could serve as a repository for developing course modules within the system. To validate the stories and potential use cases, we had an educator review and provide feedback. The educator noted that automating assignments for a course, along with the system's adaptive nature, would alleviate the human resources needed for creating course modules and reduce the time required for this process. This reinforced my team's belief that we were approaching the problem in the right direction.</p>",I created 8-step workflow which curriculum coordinators and instructors can use to create curriculum and course assignments. This is essentially a rubric that can be applied to any course or curriculum. The workflow depicts the steps in a real-world setting and the assimilation of those objects in the Learning Management System.,"The project was conceptual and exploratory; hence, we did not focus on the system's user interface or user experience. Instead, we sought to identify the workflow and capture those tasks in the system. I designed a high-fidelity prototype in Figma to depict the workflow. The video below showcases the extensive automation capabilities for course creation in Canvas when the taxonomy is pre-defined in a repository. The repository can be imported into the system as a JSON file, complete with all its relationships predefined. This approach will offer use cases for automating course creation and mapping outcomes for assessments. The level of detail and the cascading effects can be established as business or system rules to ensure consistency among educators and institutions.
<iframe src=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WUEa23EligLX7KTGuXo5EOJ6BK-Ser-j/preview"" width=""640"" height=""480"" allow=""autoplay""></iframe>","We gathered feedback on the workflow and the depth of automation. Feedback was provided by a school's curriculum coordinator and a usability expert. The curriculum coordinator liked the idea of a weighted average for Outcomes, as some criteria might be more meaningful than others. They particularly preferred the idea of the LMS recommending course outcomes instead of the instructor deciding. This <strong>reduces manual intervention and cognitive load</strong>. Each rubric is tailored to assess specific outcomes, aiding instructors and students in understanding expectations and objectives. This customization also allows for the automation of student grading. One of the questions raised was whether this conceptual model can be applied to any type of course, assessment, or rubric. This can only be determined by detailing workflows for assessments, courses, and outcomes, and applying them in a real-time pilot study.</p>
<p>The usability expert provided feedback on the interface prototype, suggesting improvements such as making interactive elements more obvious, appropriate labeling, and reducing the amount of white space.</p>
","The semester's duration prevented us from detailing user flows in the system and testing the conceptual model with a larger sample. The mapping of real-world objects with the existing system objects is a real-time exercise, and we cannot be sure that curriculum designers will find the workflow any easier. The struggle lies in interpreting the state guidelines and manually creating the taxonomy for various courses. This will be laborious and time-consuming. Metrics of the workflow also depend on the user experience in the system. Also, the course taxonomy must be defined and maintained in a repository with defined role-based access control. For future work, collaborating with an educator to develop a taxonomical model for a course is crucial for understanding real-world functions within the digital system.
  <p><h3>Poster Presentation</h3></p>
<p>For the final presentation, I created a poster on Miro to detail the goals and objectives of the project. Link: <a href=""https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMCZr5M0=/?moveToWidget=3458764585270731163&cot=14"">Poster</a></p>

2,Tractor In-Cab Display,"In this project, I collaborated with four other colleagues to <strong>investigate modern farming practices</strong> in Ames, Iowa, focusing on the use of technology. The team consisted of a software engineer, a civil engineer, an industrial engineer, and an XR developer. The goal was to examine the existing state and functionality of John Deere's <strong>electronic in-cab displays</strong> and the tasks that users perform in their daily routines.",imgs/2_cover.jpg,"The project's objective was to identify a technological function, identify areas for improvement, and propose new interface solutions. During the brainstorming phase, a teammate with a background in agricultural studies suggested exploring electronic displays used in agricultural machines. Given her previous experience at ISU's research farm and potential access to machinery and display simulators for research, we decided to proceed with this idea. Also, there was a potential for a large sample of participants, as farming is one of the prevalent occupations.<p> The motivation behind this study was to comprehend how farmhands, farmers, and agriculturalists interact with John Deere's machines and the environment in which they work. The age range of end-users varies from 17 to 70, and each person's mental model and technical proficiency are expected to vary significantly. The project's output led to task improvements, optimal interactions, and reduced frustrations. The image below depicts the <strong>hierarchical task</strong> decomposition of the existing workflow.</p>","The project duration was between February and April of 2024, and there were no significant farming practices due to harsh weather and soil conditions. With limited opportunities for field research, our team chose to work with cab simulators at one of Iowa State's student labs and also utilized John Deere's simulator website. We used John Deere's CommandArm Simulators to understand the current state of the interface and the workflow. 4600 CommandCenter & 4640 Universal Displays were utilized for the project. Though different generations of displays exist, core applications and system settings are similar. Machine settings will vary based on the type of machine (tractor, cotton harvester, sprayer, etc.).<p>Link to Display simulator: <a href=""https://displaysimulator.deere.com/"">CommandArm Simulator</a></p>","Before identifying the problem statement, my team set out to explore the current state of John Deere's cab displays. Each of us identified a key focus area in the system and decomposed tasks using <strong>Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)</strong>. This prevented us from assuming the problem statement and withdrew the temptation to identify usability issues without interacting with the users. Upon initial analysis of the user interface and workflows, we identified prevalent factors.<ul>
            <li>The user interface had large buttons and strong visual contrasts for both texts and buttons</li>
            <li>The scroll bar did not have a slider but used up and down arrows.</li>
            <li>Not a prominent use of dropdowns and multi-select checkboxes.</li>
            <li>Task reversals were accomplished by clicking on the ""close"" buttons instead of using a back button.</li>
            </ul> 
<p>There were a few more observations, but one of the reasons for such a design could be to adhere to WCAG guidelines for visual contrast and the need for a simple dialog format. Also, the users will use the display mostly with their dominant hand as they drive the machine on the farm. It is essential that buttons are visible enough with legible text even under the sunlight. So, providing a sleek, modern UI may not be best suited. Though different approaches to user experience need to be tested, given the timeline of the project, we focused on improving the </strong>learnability, natural mapping of different functions, minimizing cognitive energy for performing tasks, and error prevention</strong> rather than UI.</p>","After experimenting with the simulator on John Deere's website, I collaborated with my teammates to identify the essential data glossary and their relationships at a high level. I then created a simple definition of cards on Miro, as shown below.","For the requirement elicitation and user discussion, we identified three participants with varying levels of farming experience, which added more variability to the data. The participants were randomly selected through mutual contacts, and none of them were familiar to the team.The user research plan included: 
<ul>
<li> Elicitation workflow</li>
<li>Inquiry of participants as they perform specific tasks</li>
<li>Unstructured and structured interview</li>
<li> Questionnaires on 5 point-likert scale</li></ul>","On a fine, warm day, my team and I visited the participants for elicitation activities. We split into groups of two to interview each participant. Before initiating discussions, the participants <strong>consented</strong> to the interview, and we acknowledged our <strong>positionality</strong>; as the participants had more expertise and technical know-how. This established a <strong>good rapport</strong> with the participants, and the discussion started with a questionnaire. We used Google Forms for the question below.
<ul>
<li>PII on age, occupation</li> 
<li>Type of agricultural equipment used</li>
<li>Average use of the interface per session (measured in hours)</li>
<li>Frequency of display's usage in a year (descriptive)</li>
<li>Types of tasks performed (planting, tilling, bailing, etc.)</li>
<li> Usability rating of the interface on a scale of 1-5</li>
<li>Open-ended question on issues in the system</li>
</ul> 

The participants explained the general tasks often performed in the field during harvesting and tilling operations. They were asked to provide a walkthrough of three specific functions that were identified during the discussions: (a) resetting tillage depth value and resetting the field map of the machine, (b) adding an implement of a different brand, and (c) customizing the main page layout of the display. The discussion lasted approximately 60 minutes, during which I took notes and participated in the discussions. <p>Based on observations and information gleaned from the user discussion, recurring themes in user statements were identified. After consultations with the team, I grouped all observations based on different themes and categorized those themes into affinity maps. Connections between themes were identified and the team validated the categories. ","Participants found it difficult to customize the display, expressing a desire for more straightforward navigation to customization settings. One participant quipped, <strong> ""customization is deep into settings""</strong>. They also mentioned the hassle of manually adding tools, adjusting dimensions and settings for custom-made and third-party tools. Inexperienced and experienced users emphasized the frustration of learning tractor interfaces, highlighting the need for better user education. So our next step was to improve the <strong>dialiog initiative</strong>, <strong>customizability</strong>, and <strong>learnability</strong> of the system. 

<p>After brainstorming with my teammates, I created an <strong>activity diagram</strong> outlining a potential workflow for customizing display page layouts. We defined the scope of the project to focus on designing the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Re-design of layout manager and customization</li>
<li>Improving the current state of help documentation</li>
<li>Creating, customizing, & saving an Implement profile</li>
<li>Redesign of the field map and its mapping visualization</li>
</ul>

Participants reiterated that accessing help documentation in the display was cumbersome and was not intuitive. ",User persona created by a teammate.,"After gathering and synthesizing requirements from the elicitation process, I created a couple of low-fidelity sketches to customize the <strong>run page sets</strong> and illustrate potential user flows. The rest of the team focused on enhancing the user experience of the <strong>help documentation</strong>, <strong>improving the field map</strong>, and <strong>adding implements</strong> to John Deere's machinery. Our goal was to reduce the number of user clicks while working on display during farming activities and enhance the system's ease of use. Another focus was to redesign the natural mappings of functions. 

<p>We conducted a non-user expert evaluation study using the following <strong>heuristics principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Readability</li>
<li>Learnability</li>
<li>Minimizing memory load</li>
<li>Prevent Errors</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
</ul>

Based on the <strong>Usability Issues severity scale (Adapted from Chauncey Wilson, 1999)</strong>, we identified the severity of the expert feedback and implemented changes to workflow. ","Due to time constraints on the project, we revised the scope to focus on improving <strong>(a) the customization of the run page set</strong> and <strong>(b) the help documentation</strong>. I created hi-fidelity prototypes for customizing page layouts, and also an animation feature for the help documentation. Here is a video walk-through: 
<p><iframe src=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z6NkhNedL5h2JzDgxR8v9tb-viLid1Px/preview"" width=""640"" height=""480"" allow=""autoplay""></iframe></p>
<p>Link to the prototype: <a href=""https://www.figma.com/proto/hhK9WqnLJGa9ghMIEYGAni/Tractor-Cab-Display?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=642-7455&viewport=102%2C501%2C0.02&t=pcDmVFuoOLx7gHL0-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=642%3A7455"">Prototype</a></p>","We conducted a <strong>within-subjects</strong> experiment, testing <strong>two interface designs</strong> (independent variable), and carefully controlling the variables to ensure accuracy and fairness. Each participant was assigned one of the two designs, which allowed us to compare the impact of different interfaces on the results. In addition, we <strong>randomized the order of the tasks</strong> to minimize any potential bias on performance and to enhance the <strong>internal validity</strong> of the experiment. This randomization method was highly effective, ensuring that any effects were evenly distributed across all participants, reducing the likelihood of errors affecting the experiment's outcome. For the final experiment, participants tested the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Customization of the tractor's in-cab display dashboard</li>
<li>Learnability of a specific function in the display by using the help guide and its features</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiment was randomized to reduce the effect of confounding variables and biases. The users were tested in a lab setting with the prototype loaded into the display. Participants tested the current and proposed design. The team split into teams of two to observe the participants. A <strong>T-test</strong> was conducted for the baseline system and the proposed design, with the independent variable being the interface version. The data are represented using grouped bar charts to compare two data sets for each metric. Based on <strong>NASA TLX (NASA, 1986)</strong>, metrics on <strong>(a) mental demand</strong>, <strong>(b) physical demand</strong>, <strong>(c) temporal demand</strong>, <strong>(d) frustration</strong>, <strong>(e) performance</strong>, and <strong>(f) effort</strong> were collected. <strong>Satisfaction</strong> and <strong>frustration</strong> were also collected on a 5-point Likert Scale. Comparing the means of user metrics highlighted user preference between the baseline and the proposed system. <strong>Open-ended questions</strong> were used to collect <strong>post-trial feedback</strong> to identify themes and pain points after each trial. The charts below depicts the <strong> dependent variable</strong>, <strong>data type</strong>, <strong>data collection method</strong>, and <strong>frequency of data collection</strong>.</p>

<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4><p>For the <strong>dashboard customization task</strong>, the NASA TLX demonstrated notable improvements in the proposed design across several domains. <strong>Mental demand</strong> decreased from a mean of 7.3 to 4.3, suggesting that the redesigned interface required less cognitive effort, possibly due to a more <strong>logical arrangement</strong> of information or more straightforward workflow. <strong>Physical</strong> and <strong>temporal demand</strong> also saw reductions, indicating an interface that is less physically taxing and more efficient, allowing users to complete tasks faster. Although <strong>performance</strong> decreased slightly, this might highlight areas where the new interface could be optimized further. The <strong>effort</strong> required significantly decreased, reflecting an overall enhancement in usability and ease of interaction. <strong>Frustration</strong> levels saw <strong>little change</strong>, suggesting that while the redesign addresses many usability issues, some elements contributing to user frustration may still need attention. <strong>The 5-Point Likert Scale</strong> results correlate with the findings from the TLX, where user satisfaction improved in the proposed design, moving from a mean of 3.7 to 4.3. This improvement signifies a more positive user perception of the interface's ability to meet their needs effectively. Furthermore, a decrease in user-reported frustration supports the notion that the proposed interface mitigates factors that previously led to user dissatisfaction. 

<p>In the  <strong>help center task</strong>, the NASA TLX results reflected substantial enhancements with the proposed interface. The <strong>mental demand</strong> saw a significant drop, indicating that the redesigned help center is more straightforward and easier to navigate, likely due to better-organized content and clearer guidance. <strong>Physical demand</strong> decreased as well, which could be due to improved accessibility of help functions or more intuitively placed controls. <strong>Temporal demand</strong> remained stable, suggesting that while the interface is easier to use, the intrinsic complexity of help tasks maintains the time needed for completion. Likert Scale results from the help center task showed a dramatic increase in user satisfaction, moving from a mean of 2.0 to 4.3, which underscores a strong user preference for the redesigned interface. This is a clear indicator that the improvements made in the help center are effectively enhancing user experience</p>","The statistical power of the project is questionable because a larger sample size is needed. The visual system was not addressed in this project. Redesigning the user experience and visual system may yield different results. The interface was tested on an iPad in a controlled environment. As a result, the findings observed may differ from those obtained in a study conducted in an agricultural field."
3,Design of Ames Public Library Website,"In the summer of 2024, as a frequent visitor to the Ames Public Library, I conducted a qualitative study aimed at enhancing the library management system. To improve the user experience on the library's website, I created sketches and design proposals. My goal was to create an accessible and enjoyable experience for both frequent visitors and new visitors to the library.",imgs/3_cover.jpg,"During the summer of 2024, I frequently visited the public library in Ames. I spent most of my time reading books on art and design. I used the <a href=""https://www.amespubliclibrary.org/"" target = ""_blank"">Ames Public Library</a> website to browse book titles, place holds, and look up daily events. As I became a frequent user of the system, I became fascinated by the library management system, the relationship between objects, and how the entire system works for both library users and staff. I explored different library management systems used by libraries in the US and how they utilize third-party vendors for managing their content. The Ames library has both a legacy website and a revamped website designed around 2020, and a third-party vendor manages the library management system. The website provides general information about library events, book sales, and more.
<p>I made note of areas for improvement in the current workflow as a user and as a designer. I observed noticeable and confusing issues related to grouping of objects, unnecessary clicks, redundant workflows, and visual contrasts. After mapping out the workflow of the current system, I focused on analyzing areas for improvement and eliminating redundant user flows.<p>","Instead of relying on traditional design practices, I used <strong>Sophia Prater's Object Oriented UX</strong> for the project. This concept was developed by Sophia in 2015. The model is similar to entities and relationships between entities in a database. After learning about this process from a UX meetup in Des Moines, I realized that this process could help me in understanding the complex array of objects on the Ames Public Library's website and demystify the connections between different entities. The image below shows the process of ORCA. ","While I noticed significant usability issues in the system, I wanted to avoid confirmation bias. Therefore, I prepared my research to speak with regular users and understand their perspectives. The library demography can be categorized into five groups.
<ul>
<li>Kids</li>
<li>Yound Adults</li>
<li>Adults/Resident</li>
<li>New Residents</li>
<li>ISU Students</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon initial analysis of the system, I observed the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Visual contrast between interface elements did not follow WCAG guidelines and reduced the scannability of the information</li>
<li>Natural grouping of objects and attributes were found to be missing from workflows</li>
<li>Concise information is not obvious to the user. UI elements like accordions may not be needed to display short texts</li>
<li>The color and typography should be checked to ensure compliance with WCAG standards.</li>
</ul>
","The strategy involves using Object-Oriented UX to identify and group nouns as objects, their core content, sub-objects, and attributes, which will then be organized and displayed on a webpage. I scoured for real-world objects from conversations with people, common library-speak, and also in the existing system. The object must be a noun, place, content-type or a thing. ","The research was exploratory, and due to time constraints, I did not have a large sample size. I had discussions with adult users and some young adults. The interviews were unstructured because I believed that structured discussions would hinder my understanding of the users' mental model. I identified two frequent users of the library and set up a time to meet in their environment. Each meeting lasted an hour, during which I took field notes in my journal. Before my discussion with the participants, I organized the existing system objects according to their functions and relationships. This is illustrated in the images below.","On a warm afternoon, I visited the office of the adult participant to elicit her thoughts and ideas. Having completed her mid-day work, the adult participant sat down to spend some time with me. She explained her perspective and knowledge on how the library, space, staff, people, and the website all work together as a system. I acknowledged my positionality as she had more knowledge about the workings of the library. She also used to work for the library a few years ago. During the discussion with the participants, I posited some of the following questions:
<ul>
<li>How often do you spend time at the library?</li>
<li>What is your favorite genre of books?</li>
<li>How frequently do you set aside time to read books each week?</li>
<li>What is your thought process when you search for a particular book?</li>
<li>Do you focus on specific categories that relate to your life?</li>
<li>How long does it take for you to find your preferred book at the library?</li>
<li>Do you think there could be ways to narrow down your research and decisions despite your schedule?</li>
<li>Do you prefer to spend time there or read it at home?</li>
<li>Can you walk me through placing holds on the website?</li>
</ul>
<p>The participants appeared to be more at ease with the casual and conversational format. The discussion also involved passive contextual inquiry. The images below show my interview notes. ","I analyzed the statements made by the participants to identify underlying needs and concerns. The adult participant's choice of books or any material from the library is driven by the <strong>""lyrical quality""</strong> and the visuals of the book cover. She mentioned that some of the functions on the current website are not obvious to her, and she needs to navigate between different functions to understand them. One example she provided was to reduce the use of accordion elements and make information more evident as the user scrolls down a page. The adult participant also mentioned <strong>her active role in community events</strong> and her drive to help marginalized people. In the existing system, it can be difficult to skim the event calendar and decipher events for a specific day. Additionally, people with ADHD can find it challenging to sift through the required information. I found it quite stressful to read a wall of text with heavy emphasis.

<p>The young adult mentioned that it would be easier for her to find different series of the same book quickly and place holds in succession. While I didn't design the vendor's library management system, I did create workflows for book collections segmented by age demographics. Based on themes I discovered and my usability analysis of the website, I identified core objects, core content, metadata, and relationships between different objects. I used the ORCA process to decode the relationship, as can be seen from the images. Each image depicts the progression of identifying <strong>main object</strong>, <strong>core content</strong>, <strong>meta data</strong> and <strong>nested objects</strong>.</p>","Objects were placed and nested based on their affinity, function, and purpose. For example, in the current system <strong>Meeting and Study Rooms</strong> were mapped under <strong>Events and News</strong>. For instance, I defined the meeting and study rooms as separate entities to ensure that users interested in viewing only the events can have a more transparent and easier way of finding the relevant function. This also mimics the real-world reservation of meeting rooms, where people would walk over to the help desk and reserve a room. The green stickies in the image below depict call-to-actions associated with each object. ","After identifying all possible objects and actions, I played around with a couple of sketches. For the workflows, the sketches were analyzed for usability by an expert. Heuristics such as <strong>readability</strong>, <strong>learnability</strong>, <strong>minimize memory load</strong>, <strong>prevent errors</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong> were considered. I incorporated the feedback into my high-fidelity prototype. ","<h4>Typeface exploration</h4><p>For the typeface selection, I considered Mulish, Poppins, Lora, and Cabin. I analyzed the graphemes in each typeface, focusing on their generous x-heights, noticeable differences in the counters, the height of ascenders, and the variations among similarly shaped graphemes in the English alphabet. Ultimately, I chose the serif font Lora because it passed my tests and also conveyed a regal appearance suitable for a library website</p>

<h4>Color system</h4><p>The website brand color, #54B948, was retained in my proposed design; however, I used varying intensities of this color along with supporting colors.</p>

<h4>Prototype</h4>
<p>I grouped objects and associated actions based on the final version of the object map. In the proposed design, a snapshot of daily events is shown on the homepage, as participants mentioned that some users browse the website solely to view certain events for the day. The major functions are organized in a way that reflects the real-world operations of a library. One important task I optimized was room reservation. Instead of providing a calendar view for room availability, the availability of each room is displayed for the day, with its schedule represented as time blocks. Electronic resources in the Rooms & Technology section feature a straightforward card design, with filter categories displayed as pills. Here is a video walkthrough: <div class=""video-container"">

</div></p>","Two of the users tested the learnability and synthesizability of the proposed workflow. They found the navigation easier with clear natural mappings. The adult participant stated that she found the event listing useful, as it eliminates the need to navigate multiple pages to access information. However, one of her concerns was the listing of electronic library resources. She suggested that while the design simplifies the process of filtering categories, it would be beneficial to display the most visited and recently accessed resources tailored for each user. Participants generally found the grouping of information to be clear, but the young adult participant expressed a preference for a separate section or subsection dedicated to teens.","A larger sample size and more alternate workflows are needed for future tests. Due to time constraints and the unavailability of the library's management team, I was unable to have discussions to understand technical, historical, and functional use cases. For future work on this, I hope to collaborate with the library's management to gain access to more participants and their insights for informed decision-making. "
4,Self Data Portrait,This project shows my self-data portrait using Processing library.,imgs/4_cover.jpg,"During the fall of 2024, I created art forms through <strong>Processing</strong>. This was part of the <em>Data, Code, Form</em>  graduate course. The course was an art class with an emphasis on procedural knowledge and procedural programming. Processing is a Java library artists use to create art forms and represent data points through code. This project focuses on representing my data and creating a self-portrait using my information. I was inspired by <a href=""https://giorgialupi.com//"" class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">Giorgia Lupi's</a> dear-data project and her thoughts on humanizing data. This is also my first experience with Java programming, and learning code visually has truly encouraged me to think procedurally. I wish I had stumbled upon this sooner! 

<p>My initial idea was to represent personal traits such as personality, skills, habits, or even my grocery bills over the last three months in meaningful forms.  The idea is to represent data points that depict a picture of me in a humanizing, and inspiring way. I've always thought of data in discrete terms, but what if there is a way beyond numbers and line graphs?  I decided to find meaning in my solo travels. I created a canvas showcasing three places I have traveled to, inviting the user to enter each house for further exploration. The landscape canvas features a night mode that can be activated by clicking on the sun object. Each location is explored through a carousel of images, which includes timestamps and descriptive text. I plan to enhance this project by visually representing distance, vehicular speed, and commute time as data points. The location history data can be downloaded from Google Maps. I will soon post a video demonstrating this.</p> ",,,,,,,,,,,
5,Instructional Design Case Analysis,A case analysis of Instructional Design,imgs/5_cover.jpg,"Professor Peg Ertmer of Purdue University specializes in learning design and technology. She authored the <em>ID Casebook: Case Studies In Instructional Design</em>. The book contains open-ended cases that encourage designers to solve real-world problems. This case study was conducted for a 600-level graduate course called <em>Advanced Learning Environments</em>. I explored the use case of managing scope change in an instructional design project within the corporate context. Jack Waterkamp navigates product development and instructional design amidst stakeholder and development crises. In the study, I have detailed the problem statement, the root causes for design delays, and potential solutions depicted in the form of an Issue-Based Information system. <iframe class=""pdf"" src=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iKBBDd0qR0UqN2QFZ19dgpCoUS9iGRJG/preview"" width=""800"" height=""500""></iframe>

6,Arduino: Pulse Detector &  Visualization,"Detecting heart rate using an Arduino Uno and a pulse sensor, with the output visualized in Processing.",imgs/6_cover.jpg,"In November 2024, I worked on implementing a system that detects heart rate using a <a href = ""https://pulsesensor.com/"" target = ""_blank"">Pulse Sensor</a> and an <a href = ""https://www.arduino.cc/"" target = ""_blank"">Arduino Uno</a>. The output will control the brightness of the <a href = ""https://www.adafruit.com/product/1938"" target = ""_blank"">NeoPixel Diffused RGB LED</a>. The heart rate, measured in beats per minute, was visualized in the <strong>Processing</strong> sketchbook. The inspiration for this project was <a href = ""https://www.lozano-hemmer.com/pulse_forest.php = ""_blank"">Lozano's Pulse Forest</a>. In my project, a recursive tree visualizes the heartbeat in a vibrant HSB color spectrum.  I intended to create this visualization of a heartbeat to symbolize the interconnectedness of life and nature. This visualization can be used on a smartwatch or any device that measures heart rate. The pulsating LED dances to the rhythm of a heartbeat, signifying the essence of life.","For this project, an Arduino UNO R3, a Pulse Sensor, a 16x2 LCD display, a NeoPixel LED, and several jumper wires were used. The coding and sketching were done using Arduino IDE, Processing, and Fritzing.",,,,,,,"Before wiring the components, I laid out the schematics in <strong>Fritzing</strong>. I connected the 5V pin from the Arduino Uno to the positive rail of the breadboard and the GND pin to the negative rail. Two Pulse Sensor's terminal pins were connected to the breadboard, with the analog pin linked to the A0 pin on the Arduino. The A0 pin is used for reading analog values.

<p>A 220 ohm resistor was used for connecting a <strong>NeoPixel Diffused RGB LED</strong>. A 1k ohm resistor connected to  <strong>16x2 LCD display</strong>. Here is a detailed breakdown of what I was trying to achieve:

<ol>
<li>Install the libraries for sensors and LED from the supplier's website, and import them into the Arduino code</li>
<li>Upload the code to the Arduino Uno's microcontroller via serial port</li>
<li>Measure the heart rate via Pulse Sensor and send the value to Arduino Uno</li>
<li>Define three ranges for the BPM(beats per minute) - normal, high, low</li>
<li>Show the BPM value and a message on the LCD. Each range has three distinct messages for the user</li>
<li>If a BPM is detected, the LED lights up green. The light pulsates to mimic the heartbeat</li>
<li>If a heartbeat is not detected, the LED will default to a white hue</li>
<li>Arduino transmits the BPM value to Processing through the serial port</li>
<li>For every detected heartbeat, tree growth is triggered based on recursion and repetition</li>
</ol>

For instance, NeoPixel does not follow the RGB order mentioned in the document, but rather the GRB order. For future work on this project, I hope to utilize a series of NeoPixel LEDs along with additional Pulse Sensors. This will create a compelling visual effect. I also plan to code the Processing sketch in a way that the recursive tree growth is controlled by different sensors and interacts with other trees based on the intensity of the BPM (beats per minute). This will help to visualize the symbolic interconnectivity of people who place their fingers on the sensor. I'm also thinking of using the OpenCV library to detect emotions and send the data to Arduino."
7,Design Ethnography,I conducted a series of field studies using a rapid ethnographic format. This was a three-week study conducted at two field sites. The methods used were participant observation and contextual inquiry.,imgs/7_cover.jpg,The field notes are currently in the coding and analysis stage. I am using NVivo to analyze the qualitative data and will post my thoughts and results soon!,,,,,,,,,,,
