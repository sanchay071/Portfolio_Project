            <h3>About My Projects</h3>
            <p>The works listed below pertain to my course projects at Iowa State University as well as personal projects. During my time at Revature, I was responsible for requirements engineering, agile product development, and stakeholder management. In 2023, I collaborated with a cross-functional team of developers, UX designers, and product managers to create a headless Learning Management System (LMS) called Exa, designed to support an asynchronous training process.</p>
            <p>As a business analyst, my responsibilities included user research, requirements elicitation, and business analysis. I also facilitated the design and development of learning management and content management systems, serving as the product owner for an in-house student assessment tool. My key functions included product <strong>backlog management</strong>, <strong>creating user stories</strong>, <strong>sprint planning</strong>, <strong>API testing</strong>, <strong>user acceptance testing</strong>, <strong>requirements analysis and design</strong>, and <strong>prototyping</strong>. I will work on adding some of my work projects, as some of them are confidential.</p>
            <p>If you would like more details about my work at Revature or references from colleagues, please feel free to reach out! </p>
